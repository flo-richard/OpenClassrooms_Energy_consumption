# OpenClassrooms_Scoring

This project aims at predicting the energy consumption and GHG emissions of non-residential buildings, using measurements of such builings in Seattle available at https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy
We test here several regression models, both linear and non-linear. The exploration notebook aims at cleaning, vizualizing and feature engineering data. We preprocess the data, train and compare several models in the model notebook.
